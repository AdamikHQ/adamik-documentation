## Testing the New API

You can test and explore the updated API endpoints in two ways:

### OpenAPI Specification

The new OpenAPI specification is available at:
https://api-staging.adamik.io/openapi.json

### Developer Portal

Our developer portal now includes a version selector near the Adamik logo. To test the new endpoints:

1. Locate the version selector near the Adamik logo
2. Select the next version
3. Use the interactive Swagger UI to test the updated endpoints

## General Changes

1. HTTP Method Changes:

   - Most POST endpoints converted to GET where they were only used for reading data
   - POST methods retained only for actual data modifications/submissions

2. URL Structure:

   - Consistent pattern: `/api/{chainId}/...`
   - Resource identifiers moved to URL paths
   - Query parameters used only for filtering and pagination

3. Pagination:

   - Consistent nextPage token approach across all paginated endpoints
   - Token passed via query parameter

4. Response Formats:
   - Added more detailed error and warning messages in status object
   - Consistent structure across all endpoints
