Adamik API utilizes standard HTTP response codes to indicate the outcome of API requests:


## HTTP Response Codes

- **2xx codes** indicate successful operations.
- **4xx codes** signify client errors, such as missing parameters or failed validations.
- **5xx codes** are used to indicate server-side errors within the Adamik systems (these should be infrequent).
