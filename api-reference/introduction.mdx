The Adamik API adheres to RPC principles, providing streamlined and predictable interactions for blockchain integration in cryptocurrency applications. It features resource-oriented URLs, accepts and returns JSON-encoded data, and uses standard HTTP methods and response codes.

## Chain-Agnostic Philosophy

The Adamik API is designed with a chain-agnostic approach, ensuring that developers do not need to handle specific blockchain logic within their codebase. This means that the API avoids endpoints tied exclusively to particular blockchain types or families. The focus is on delivering a unified interface that abstracts away the complexities of individual blockchains, enabling seamless integration across various chains without requiring chain-specific adaptations.

## Focused Functionality

Each API request processes single objects to ensure precise updates, supporting clear and straightforward blockchain interactions. This precision aligns with our goal of maintaining simplicity and clarity in blockchain integrations.

## OpenAPI Specification

The Adamik API is detailed in an OpenAPI Description (OAD). You can access the full specification via the [OpenAPI endpoint](./endpoint/get-openapi).

## Versioning

Currently in beta, the Adamik API is continuously enhanced to meet diverse needs with new versions and features. Our chain-agnostic design drives ongoing development, ensuring future updates are flexible and scalable across all blockchain ecosystems.
