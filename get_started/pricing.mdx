## How It Works

Your costs are recalculated immediately after each API call, based on a rolling 30-day total. As your usage changes, the price per call adjusts to match the appropriate tier.

### Pricing Tiers

| **Tier** |      **API Calls**       | **Price per Call** |
| :------: | :----------------------: | :----------------: |
|    1     |       0 - 500,000        |     $0.000711      |
|    2     |   500,001 - 1,000,000    |     $0.000640      |
|    3     |  1,000,001 - 5,000,000   |     $0.000569      |
|    4     |  5,000,001 - 15,000,000  |     $0.000498      |
|    5     | 15,000,001 - 50,000,000  |     $0.000285      |
|    6     | 50,000,001 - 100,000,000 |     $0.000231      |
|    7     |    Above 100,000,000     |     $0.000107      |

### Chain Access Fee

- **Monthly Fee**: $100 per blockchain, recurring as long as access to the chain is required.

You only pay for the blockchains you use, allowing you to manage costs effectively.

## Example: Monthly Cost Calculation

**Example Scenario:**

- **Chains Used**: 3
- **Total API Calls**: 1,200,000 (monthly)

### Calculation:

1. **API Call Charges**:

   - First 500,000 calls:  
     `500,000 × 0.000711 = $355.50`
   - Next 500,000 calls (Tier 2):  
     `500,000 × 0.000640 = $320.00`
   - Remaining 200,000 calls (Tier 3):  
     `200,000 × 0.000569 = $113.80`
   - **Total API Call Cost**:  
     `$789.30`

2. **Chain Access Cost**:  
   `3 × 100 = $300`

3. **Total Monthly Cost**:  
   `$789.30 + $300 = $1,089.30`
