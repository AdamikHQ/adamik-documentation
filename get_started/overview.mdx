Before delving into the detailed specifications and API references, it's recommended to review the high-level principles below. This preliminary step aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the APIs' capabilities and operational dynamics.

## Flow of operations

The Adamik API operates on a client/server model. 
Your application handles interfacing with wallet signers and capturing user intents, while Adamik servers manage on-chain data retrieval and transaction engineering (crafting).

## Read and Write APIs


The Adamik APIs are segregated into two principal categories: 
- the **Read API** for data retrieval and the **Write API** for transaction management. Both APIs are standardized across a wide range of blockchain networks.
- Beyond the core APIs, Adamik extends its functionality through the **Utility API** which provides tools for various operational needs, such as address format validation, transaction fee estimation, and network congestion assessment.
