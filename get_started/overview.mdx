The Adamik APIs are segregated into two principal categories: 
- the **Read API** for data retrieval and the **Write API** for transaction management. Both APIs are standardized across a wide range of blockchain networks.
- Beyond the core APIs, Adamik extends its functionality through the **Utility API** which provides tools for various operational needs, such as address format validation, transaction fee estimation, and network congestion assessment.
