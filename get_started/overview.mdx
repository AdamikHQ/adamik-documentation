Before exploring the detailed specifications and API references, review these high-level principles for an overview of the APIâ€™s capabilities and workflow.

## Flow of operations

The Adamik API follows a client/server model. Your application handles user intents and signing, while the Adamik server manages on-chain data retrieval and transaction creation, ensuring user actions are executed on the blockchain.
The diagram below outlines the basic flow of interactions between an App and the Adamik API.

    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Fetch account state and history
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return account data and history

    %% Transaction Process %%
    Note right of CLIENT: Transaction Process
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Initiate transaction
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return unsigned transaction
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Send signature

    %% Transaction Status %%
    Note right of CLIENT: Transaction Status
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Get transaction status/history/balance
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return updated transaction data
```

## Read and Write APIs

The Adamik APIs are divided into two principal categories:

- **Read API**: For data retrieval, including fetching account details and transaction history.
- **Write API**: For managing transactions such as cryptocurrency transfers or staking operations.

These APIs work consistently across various blockchain networks.

In addition to the core APIs, Adamik offers the **Utility API** to support common operational needs. It includes tools for address format validation, or pubkey conversion to addresses, helping to streamline crypto application development.
