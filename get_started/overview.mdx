Before delving into the detailed specifications and API references, it's recommended to review the high-level principles below. This preliminary step aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the APIs' capabilities and operational dynamics.


The Adamik APIs are segregated into two principal categories: the **Read API** for data retrieval and the **Write API** for transaction management. Both APIs are standardized across a wide range of blockchain networks.

## Read API

The Read API enables essential data access functions, such as:

- Retrieving balance information for on-chain addresses.
- Extracting network details from nodes, such as fee estimation.

## Write API

Unlike traditional solutions, the Write API is:

- Fully stateless
- Designed without needing access to private keys

Usage scenarios for the Write API encompass a range of transaction-related activities, from executing straightforward cryptocurrency or token transfers to delegations or smart contract interactions.


## Additional Services

Beyond the core APIs, Adamik extends its functionality through the **Utility API** which provides tools for various operational needs, such as address format validation, transaction fee estimation, and network congestion assessment.
