Before exploring the detailed specifications and API references, review these high-level principles for an overview of the APIâ€™s capabilities and workflow.

## Flow of operations

The Adamik API operates on a client/server model. Your application captures user intents and has signing capabilities. The Adamik server manages on-chain data retrieval and transaction crafting, ensuring that user intents are properly translated and executed on the blockchain.

The diagram below outlines the basic flow of interactions between the app, the user, and the Adamik API.

    APP->>ADAMIK API: Get account state and history
    ADAMIK API->>APP: Return account data and history

    USER->>APP: Initiate transaction (intent)
    APP->>ADAMIK API: Share intent
    ADAMIK API->>APP: Return prepared transaction
    APP->> USER: Request approval
    USER->>APP: Approve prepared transaction
    APP->>ADAMIK API: Return transaction signature
    ADAMIK API->>APP: Assemble transaction & signature, and broadcast

    USER->>APP: Get transaction status
    APP->>ADAMIK API: Fetch transaction info / history / balance
    ADAMIK API->>APP: Return updated transaction history and balances
```

## Read and Write APIs

The Adamik APIs are divided into two principal categories:

- **Read API**: For data retrieval, including fetching account details and transaction history.
- **Write API**: For managing transactions such as cryptocurrency transfers or staking operations.

These APIs work consistently across various blockchain networks.

In addition to the core APIs, Adamik offers the **Utility API** to support common operational needs. It includes tools for address format validation, or pubkey conversion to addresses, helping to streamline crypto application development.
