Before exploring the detailed specifications and API references, review these high-level principles for an overview of the APIâ€™s capabilities and workflow.

## Flow of operations

The Adamik API operates on a client/server model. Your application captures user intents and has signing capabilities. The Adamik server manages on-chain data retrieval and transaction crafting, ensuring that user intents are properly translated and executed on the blockchain.

The diagram below outlines the basic flow of interactions between the app, the user, and the Adamik API.

    %% Application Bootstrapping %%
    USER->>CLIENT: Application starts
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Request supported chains and networks
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return chains and networks info

    %% Account Management %%
    USER->>CLIENT: Check account status
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Fetch account state and history
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return account data and history

    %% Transaction Process %%
    USER->>CLIENT: Initiate transaction (intent)
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Share intent
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Prepare transaction
    CLIENT->>USER: Request approval
    USER->>CLIENT: Approve/Sign transaction
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Send signature
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Assemble and broadcast transaction

    %% Transaction Status %%
    USER->>CLIENT: Check transaction status
    CLIENT->>ADAMIK: Get transaction status / history / balance
    ADAMIK->>CLIENT: Return updated transaction data

```

## Read and Write APIs

The Adamik APIs are divided into two principal categories:

- **Read API**: For data retrieval, including fetching account details and transaction history.
- **Write API**: For managing transactions such as cryptocurrency transfers or staking operations.

These APIs work consistently across various blockchain networks.

In addition to the core APIs, Adamik offers the **Utility API** to support common operational needs. It includes tools for address format validation, or pubkey conversion to addresses, helping to streamline crypto application development.
