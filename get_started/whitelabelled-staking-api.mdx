## Overview

The Adamik Staking White-Labeled API is a fully integrated, non-custodial solution designed specifically for staking providers. This API enables staking providers to seamlessly provide staking functionalities to Enterprise and Institutional clients.

## Why Staking Providers Need a Staking API

Staking providers need to reach users where they already are: on wallets, exchanges, custodians, and institutional platforms. However, infrastructure excellence is sometimes not sufficient to reach these players.

Staking providers need to solve their clients' problems by facilitating the technical integration of the underlying protocols they operate on. Many staking providers have understood this and have spent tens of thousands in development resources to build their own staking API solutions.

Adamik's white-labeled staking API allows staking providers to release their own Staking API in a matter of days, at a fraction of the cost, and without dealing with maintenance or support.

## Product Description

Adamik White-Labeled Staking API offers powerful API tools designed to simplify staking across multiple blockchain networks, providing a faster and more reliable alternative to building everything in-house.

        blockchain interactions themselves.

## Pricing

Staking Providers are responsible for the API consumption cost by their clients.

By default, the pay-as-you-go plan is applied, which includes a flat fee of $250 USD per month covering 10,000 API calls.

Beyond this, pricing follows a tiered model, where the cost per call decreases as usage increases (similar to an exchange model). See this documentation for details.
